<p>The process is highly iterative - parts of the process often need to be repeated many times before another can be entered - though the parts that get iterated and the number of such cycles in any given project may vary. Straighter waterlines in the aft section of the hulls running bottom mean a shorter more efficient path for water to take along the bottom resulting in less drag. Waterline contours below the design waterline can generally be thought of as the path water takes as it interacts with the hull bottom creating lift and drag at speed. These objects can be arranged in any way as part of your composition. To accomplish this designers make use of their knowledge of material behavior andor of processes coupled with their ability to analyze ie.</p>
