<p>The 40 SW has nearly identical accuracy with the 9mm but it has an energy advantage over the 9mm and more manageable recoil than the 10 mm Auto cartridge. While the 9mm can achieve similar effects as the 40 SW its with premium ammo that costs significantly more than your baseline 9mm ammunition. These are both great choices that have a huge gun pool to choose from with 9mm still the king of the hill and the 40 SW only trailing the 45 ACP in terms of gun options at most retailers.

<p>Since 1990 it has been the darling of law enforcement. Since the 40 SW is essentially just a short 10mm round it features higher breach pressure than both 9mm and 45 ACP. The 9mm has a slight edge in penetration the 45 a slight edge in expansion and the 40 SW is sort of a compromise. Its so good its hard to tell the difference in how they work from other rounds.

<p>From cinderblocks makeshift walls to bricks and concrete each round delivers varying results. It probably has more stopping power than 389mm but is smaller than 45 and fits into several subcompacts originally designed for 9mm. Any difference in the old hammer bite problem Thanks.

<p>The 40 SW was built as a compromise cartridge to offer more power than the 9mm with less recoil and more capacity than the 45. Obviously the slighter 9mm edges out the 40 SW and 45 ACP in terms of capacity and loaded weight. The 40 SW fires a larger bullet 124 gr vs 180 gr that will theoretically create a larger permanent wound cavity and incapacitate a bad guy faster. The 40 SW is actually to the 10mm as the 380 is to the 9mm in that its literally just a shorter 10mm. Pin On Handguns.</p>
