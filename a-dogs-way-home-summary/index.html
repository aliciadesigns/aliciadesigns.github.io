<p>The movie is clearly derived from a book and plays out chronologically. PG for thematic elements some peril and language. This is a fantastic and exhilarating journey of the heart that brilliantly speaks to the incredible power of love and resilience of spirit that tie us together&ndash;making it a perfect gift for everyone whos ever loved a dog. Its nothing you need to see but itll please the target audience for sure. Shelby S Story A Dog S Way Home Tale A Dog S Purpose Puppy Tales Series By W Bruce Cameron Paperback Barnes Noble.</p>
