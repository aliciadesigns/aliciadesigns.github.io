<p>Research study designs are of many types each with its advantages and limitations. Just as the key elements and determinants of outcomes of war are fixed even before it is fought ie at its planning stages the success of a study is also largely determined at its initial planning stage. A research method is a strategy used to implement that plan. The study designs themselves were secondary to our interest. Research design is the overall structure of the research.</p>
